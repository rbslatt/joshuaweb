          <h1>In Brazil, the climate crisis is already turning working people into climate refugees</h1>
          <p>outhern Brazil is facing its worst climate tragedy ever,” Latin-America-based journalist Mike Fox wrote from Brazil for the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) in early May. “Unprecedented floods have impacted 1.4 million people and forced more than 160,000 people from their homes… The images are shocking. Downtown Porto Alegre, the capital of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, is underwater… On May 2, a dam collapsed, unleashing an over 6-foot-high wave and worsening flooding in the area… Although the tragedy is a natural disaster, experts have pointed out that the lack of preparedness on the part of state and local officials may have contributed to the devastation. According to one report, Porto Alegre slashed funds for flooding prevention over the last three years and didn’t spend a cent on it in 2023.” <br><br>

            In this episode, we talk with Mike about his reporting trip to Southern Brazil, the devastation he witnessed firsthand, and the conversations he had with poor and working-class people who have borne the worst impacts of the floods and who continue to bear the greatest costs of man-made climate chaos.</p>

          <h1>Climate Summit ‘Last Chance’ for Brazil to Show Leadership on Global Warming</h1>
          <p>WASHINGTON—President Joe Biden’s climate summit of 40 world leaders this week will be Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s “last chance” to restore Washington’s confidence in Brazil’s commitment to taking action to fight climate change, the U.S. ambassador to Brazil has warned. <br><br>

            But pressure from Brazilian civil society groups has complicated the situation for Bolsonaro, and paved the way for one of its neighbors—Colombia—to step in as Latin America’s primary leader on climate. <br><br>
            
            A bilateral agreement Brazilian officials had hoped could be announced during the summit has stalled after nearly 200 Brazilian advocacy groups sent a joint letter to Biden earlier this month, calling on him to “choose between being true to his speech and lending political prestige and money to Bolsonaro.” They warned that negotiating with the Brazilian president “is not the same as helping Brazil solve its problems.” <br><br>
            
            Meanwhile, Biden’s top aide for Latin America, Juan Gonzalez, met with Colombian President Iván Duque last week to discuss the country’s regional climate leadership. Gonzalez’s South American tour did not include a stop in Brazil. </p>
