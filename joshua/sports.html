          <h1>POSTED INEDGE OF SPORTS TV Anwar El-Ghazi is an example of pro-Palestine solidarity for the pro sports world</h1>
          <p>The silence of the sports world in the face of Israel’s genocide in Gaza grows more deafening by the day. Only a few athletes like Anwar El-Ghazi of the Netherlands have dared to take a public stand in support of Palestine—and in El-Ghazi’s case, he has paid for it with his job. In times like these, attempts to remain apolitical are simply unacceptable. Dave Zirin takes aim at the silence of the sports world on Palestine in this edition of “Choice Words.”</p>
