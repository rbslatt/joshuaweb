          <h1>‘DERAIL BATORY’: SENATE URGED TO REJECT EX-TRUMP OFFICIAL FOR AMTRAK BOARD</h1>
          <p>An alliance of unionized rail workers on Tuesday demanded that the U.S. Senate reject President Joe Biden’s nomination of former Trump administration official Ronald Batory to serve on the board of Amtrak, the nation’s passenger rail company. <br><br>
            In a statement, Railroad Workers United (RWU) said Batory’s tenure as head of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) under former President Donald Trump “was marked by policies favoring ‘operational efficiencies’ (i.e., corporate profits) over the safety and well-being of rail workers and the public.” <br><br>

“Notably, under his leadership, FRA attempted to override state laws mandating two-person train crews, promoting instead the adoption of single-person crews nationally,” said RWU. “This push was part of a broader deregulation agenda, ostensibly aimed at reducing operational costs for the monopoly of carriers at the potential expense of safety and labor protections.” <br><br>

“Moreover, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Batory oversaw the FRA’s issuance of emergency waivers that suspended numerous long-standing safety regulations,” the group added. “These waivers were granted rapidly with limited opportunity for stakeholder input, raising significant concerns among rail labor organizations about their sweeping breadth and the lack of stringent oversight, which could compromise rail safety and worker security.” <br><br>

The statement urges rail workers across the country to contact their senators and demand they block Batory’s nomination. <br><br>

“His record clearly demonstrates a prioritization of carrier profits over the safety of rail workers and the traveling public,” said RWU, calling the Senate to “derail Batory.”</p>
