          <h1>‘War’ is not killing Palestinians, Israel is. Our media should frame it this way</h1>
          <p>The party responsible for a war crime—or any act of mass violence—is important information and something that should be named at the forefront of any news documenting said war crime or act of mass violence. This much seems obvious, but the “War in Gaza” has created a particularly grimy editorial genre of Natural Disaster-izing mass death. Specific episodes of mass killing, disease, and displacement at the hands of Israel as it carries out siege, occupation, and bombing are all too often covered like one would a deadly volcano or earthquake: The party responsible is not a specific government or military but a mysterious, agency-free “war,” “disaster,” or “humanitarian crisis.” <br><br>

            Israel’s responsibility is often mentioned or alluded to––typically in scare quotes––in the text further down the page, but it is not centered or made obvious, thus meaningfully reducing any political urgency around their guilt.  <br><br>
            
            The most egregious practitioner of this grim editorial genre is the New York Times, which has obscured who is killing tens of thousands in Gaza with new lows of confusion and hand-wringing. Here are just a handful of headlines published over the past eight months which one could read, and re-read a dozen times, and still not be sure who is killing whom: </p>

          <h1>FOR WESTERN MEDIA, ISRAEL’S BOMBING OF GAZA IS NOT ‘DEADLY’</h1>
          <p>Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed in two separate incidents in Gaza on 22 January. Mainstream media outlets around the world reacted in unison: that this was the “deadliest day” for Israel since 7 October. <br><br>

            This exact phrase was used in headlines on 23 January carried by news agencies such as Reuters and AFP, and major broadcasters including the BBC, CBS, NBC, CNN, ABC and ITV News. <br><br>
            
            The exact same phrase was also used by leading news titles including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Time magazine, Daily Telegraph, the Sun, Jerusalem Post, Guardian, London’s Evening Standard, Financial Times, Independent and Yahoo News. <br><br>
            
            On the same day, Israeli forces killed almost 200 Palestinians in Gaza including at least 65 people in Khan Younis alone. <br><br>
            
            These deaths received no headlines in the above outlets. Where they were reported, they were listed as part of the regular daily round-up of events in an unfolding genocide that has now seen more than 26,000 people killed in Gaza. <br><br>
            
            How is it possible that the world’s media could embrace exactly the same phrase in relation to Israeli victims but largely ignore the identities of the much higher number of Palestinians killed? <br><br>
            
            Why would 22 January be described as “deadly” for one group of people but not for another?</p>
