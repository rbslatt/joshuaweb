          <h2>Ombudsman junks Alice Guo's bid vs suspension order</h2>
            <img src="image/alicegou.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The Office of the Ombudsman has junked Bamban, Tarlac mayor Alice Guo's bid to lift the six-month
            preventive <br> suspension slapped against her over her alleged 
            links to a raided Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) <br> in  her jurisdiction.</p>
          <h3>The Ombudsman resolution dated June 21 said it is standing by its preliminary findings <br> that there are sufficient
            grounds to hold that the evidence against Guo and the  other <br> respondents are strong.</h3>
          <p>In its resolution signed by Ombudsman Samuel R. Martires, 
            there is evidence that Guo has business interest in <br> Baofu Land Development Inc., 
            owner of the land where the raided POGO was located. It said this was shown by a <br> Tarlac Electric 
            Cooperative Inc Statement of Account dated March 8, 2024 under Guo's name that  was seized <br> during the March 13, 2024 raid 
            in the Baofu compound for alleged human trafficking and serious illegal detention.
