          <h1>NPC orders Mayor Guo expulsion</h1>
          <p>MANILA – The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) has expelled Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo, adding to the woes of the controversial local chief executive.

            Guo is currently serving an Ombudsman-ordered six-month suspension, which started May 31, and faces human trafficking charges filed by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) and the Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG).
            
            In a letter signed by NPC chair Vicente Sotto III on June 22 and addressed to Tarlac Governor Susan Yap who petitioned the removal, Guo is ordered removed from the roster of members.
            
            Party secretary general Secretary Mark Llandro Mendoza, Presidential Adviser on Legislative Affairs and head of the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office, will implement the order and inform Guo of her removal from NPC.
            
            “The NPC will not tolerate any unlawful acts or any appearance of impropriety by its members that will undermine the principle of our party,” read the NPC letter, released to the media on Sunday.
            
            On Friday, the PAOCC and PNP-CIDG filed a qualified human trafficking complaint against Guo, former Technology and Livelihood Resource Center deputy director general Dennis Cunanan, 12 officers and incorporators of three companies, and Guo’s alleged business partners Huang Zhiyang, Zhang Ruijin and Baoying Li before the Department of Justice.
            
            The case against Guo and the others stemmed from the raid at the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator hub Zun Yuan Technology Inc. in Bamban in March.
            
            Huang is a fugitive in China, while Zhang and Baoying are allegedly involved in a major money laundering case in Singapore.
            
            An Immigration Lookout Bulletin Order against Guo and the other respondents may be out next week.
            
            Previously, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) said it would look into Guo and the names and entities connected with her.
            
            "Due process will be followed. If the income declared with the BIR does not match the value of the properties amassed during the same taxable years, criminal cases for tax evasion will be filed. The same charges can be filed against conspirators and the corporate officers of the companies used to amass such wealth," BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. said.
            
            Guo, Municipal Business Permits and Licensing Office’s Edwin Ocampo and municipal legal office Adenn Sigua are suspended due to “strong evidence showing their guilt" on the charges of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and gross neglect of duty.
            
            Prior to the suspension, Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. ordered the National Police Commission on May 20 to initiate proceedings to revoke Guo's control over the local police within her jurisdiction. (PNA)</p>

          <h1>PBBM to announce new DepEd chief before end-June</h1>
          <p>MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Thursday said he would announce by the end of the week the replacement of Vice President Sara Duterte as Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary.

            Marcos, in a media interview, said the Education department is arguably the most important government agency and should not be left without a head.
            
            “We have to carry on and the Department of Education is, possibly, arguably the most important department. Because education is that important. So no matter the change of leadership within the department, we still have to carry on,” Marcos told Palace reporters.
            
            “So we are now, I will probably be able to, I would like to be able to announce the appointment of the DepEd Secretary by the end of the week. We cannot leave it open. We cannot just leave it like that nakatiwangwang lang na walang (vacant without a) secretary,” he said.
            
            Duterte resigned as DepEd Secretary and vice chairperson of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) last week, essentially leaving the Cabinet of the Marcos administration.
            
            In her resignation letter, Duterte said she has prepared a 30-day plan to ensure the seamless transition of the DepEd.
            
            The President said Duterte did not provide any reason for stepping down from the Cabinet.
            
            “She didn’t give any reason. I asked her, is there any particular reason why she has chosen to resign from the Department of Education and the NTF-ELCAC. And she said, ‘Wag na lang nating pag-usapan’, so I did not force the issue,” he said.
            
            UniTeam's fate
            
            Marcos and Duterte ran and won under the UniTeam Coalition during the 2022 elections.
            
            When asked if there is still a UniTeam, Marcos said it is up to Duterte.
            
            “Depende lang kung ano position ni Inday Sara pagdating sa election. Siya ba ay nasa administrasyon o siya ba ay nasa oposisyon? That will be the only major determinant. But as the parties involved, pareho pa rin ang UniTeam, hindi pa nagbago (It depends on Inday Sara's position when the election comes. Is she in the administration or is she in the opposition? That will be the only major determinant. But as the parties involved, the UniTeam is still the same, it hasn't changed,)” he said.
            
            Hope for next DepEd chief
            
            A group of Catholic schools, meanwhile, hopes the next DepEd secretary will promote the welfare of both public and private educational institutions.
            
            In an interview with Church-run Radio Veritas on Thursday, Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP) president Fr. Albert Delvo said Duterte’s successor must have the vision to jointly address the problems of the education sector and boost its growth.
            
            Delvo also recognized Duterte’s efforts in working closely with various sectors during her tenure.
            
            "We respect VP Sara Duterte's decision to resign from her position as DepEd secretary. Resignation is an option for employees, including elected and appointed public officials, during her tenure as DepEd Secretary, she conducted periodic consultations with Private Education leaders such as COCOPEA (Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations of the Philippines), CEAP and MaPSA (Manila Ecclesiastical Province School Systems Association). We appreciate this effort," he said.
            
            Delvo, meanwhile, wished Duterte the best in the discharge of her duties as the country’s second highest official. (with Ferdinand Patinio/PNA)</p>
