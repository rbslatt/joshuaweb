          <h1>POSTED INUNDER THE SHADOW Honduras, 2009. La Resistencia | Under the Shadow, Episode 7, Part 1</h1>
          <p>n June 2009, Honduras faced a devastating coup that shattered the country’s fragile democracy and sunk the country into violence, repression, and a decade-long narco-dictatorship. <br><br>
            In this episode, host Michael Fox dives into the tremendous resistance to the 2009 coup. He also looks at the government of Manuel Zelaya, the Latin America Pink Tide movement of the 2000s, and the push back from Honduran elites and the United States. <br><br>

            This is Part 1 of a two-part episode looking at the 2009 coup in Honduras and the aftermath. <br><br>
            
            Under the Shadow is a new investigative narrative podcast series that walks back in time, telling the story of the past by visiting momentous places in the present. <br><br>
            
            In each episode, host Michael Fox takes us to a location where something historic happened — a landmark of revolutionary struggle or foreign intervention. Today, it might look like a random street corner, a church, a mall, a monument, or a museum. But every place he takes us was once the site of history-making events that shook countries, impacted lives, and left deep marks on the world. </p>
