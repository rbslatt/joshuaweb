          <h1>At this very moment, a student-led grassroots movement is spreading throughout the country, with over 100 encampments going up at different college and university campuses around the country and around the world in protest of Israel’s US-funded genocidal war on Gaza and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

The encampment follows six months of student protests for the University’s divestment, which began with a sit-in at the President’s house in October. Since then, students have continuously organized protests across campus demanding the University divest from Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.” TRNN’s Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez (who is an alumnus of the University of Michigan), speaks with Salma Hamamy, an undergraduate at UM and president of Students Allied For Freedom and Equality (SAFE), and Ember McCoy, a graduate student worker and department organizer in the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO).</p>
