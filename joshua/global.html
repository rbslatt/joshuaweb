          <h1>South China Sea clash raises fears of full-blown conflict</h1>
          <p>As Palestinian journalists and trade unionists, we call on our fellow journalists around the world to take action to stop the horrifying bombardment of our people in Gaza and to adhere to the ethical principle of our profession. <br><br>
            The world watches in horror as Israel attacks civilians in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip from the land, sea and air, killing more than 9,000, injuring more than 30,000, and leaving many others trapped under the rubble. Meanwhile, Israel has distributed thousands of automatic weapons to extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank, who are openly planning and executing acts of wholesale ethnic cleansing.</p>
