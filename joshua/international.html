          <p>The drumbeat of intervention is rolling once again for Haiti. Since last year, plans have been laid for a US-sponsored intervention in Haiti nominally led by Kenya, ostensibly in the name of fighting “gang violence” in the Caribbean nation. While corporate media has breathlessly pushed the narrative of a lawless Haiti overrun by criminal organizations, such framing deliberately excludes the role of the US and its allies in the so-called Core Group in destabilizing Haiti over the past 20 years in particular—not to mention the past two centuries since Haiti’s independence.
