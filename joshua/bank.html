          <h1>POSTED INTHE MARC STEINER SHOW ‘It was petrifying’: An aid worker’s account of life in the West Bank under apartheid</h1>
          <p>The genocide in Gaza has captured the attention of the world, but nowhere in Palestine is safe from Israel’s onslaught. Israeli repression, land grabs, and deadly raids in the West Bank have increased dramatically since Oct. 7. Long subjected to a brutal apartheid system and routine attacks from settlers and the IDF, Palestinians in the West Bank now face a more aggravated Zionist threat than before, with “no light at the end of the tunnel.” Palestinian-American humanitarian Joyce Ajlouny, director of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), joins The Marc Steiner Show to discuss her recent trip to Ramallah, West Bank, her decades of on-the-ground humanitarian work in Palestine, and the services AFSC aid workers continue to bravely provide to hundreds of thousands of people under the worst of conditions.</p>
