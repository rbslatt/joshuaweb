          <h1>THE RACIST HISTORY OF THE KANSAS CITY ‘CHIEFS</h1>
          <p>The history of white supremacy in US sports culture is as old as the games, and the nation, themselves. Recent years have seen a push to change the names of the most egregious offenders, most notably the former name of the Washington Commanders. Yet some teams’ problematic names and histories have comparatively flown under the radar. Such is the case with the Kansas City football team. Radio host Rhonda LeValdo, a co-founder of the organization Not In Our Honor, joins Edge of Sports for a frank discussion on the racist history of the Kansas City football team, and why its name should be changed.          </p>
